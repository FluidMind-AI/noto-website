## SECTION 4: FAQ

**Layout:** Accordion style. Each question is a clickable row that expands to reveal the answer. All collapsed by default. Stacked vertically, full-width on desktop and mobile.

**Section heading:** Frequently Asked Questions

---

**Q1: What does "Complete Privacy" actually mean?**

Your recordings, transcriptions, and notes never leave your device. Nothing is sent to external servers. There are no third-party API connections. Your data is never used to train any AI model — ours or anyone else's. When we say private, we mean nothing goes out.

---

**Q2: How do Pro cloud features work? Are they required?**

No. Cloud features in Pro — like cloud sync and cloud processing — are entirely optional. By default, Pro works the same way as the Founders plan: everything stays on your device. You turn on cloud features only if and when you want them. You stay in control.

---

**Q3: What does "Coming soon" mean? When will those features launch?**

It means the feature is in development and will be added in a future update. We don't commit to specific dates. When a feature is ready, it ships. You'll never be charged extra for features marked as coming soon within your plan — they're included when they arrive.

---

**Q4: What does "unlimited" mean exactly?**

Unlimited meetings, recordings, and transcriptions means there are no caps on how many you can create. NotoNote is built for real, regular use — daily meetings, lectures, interviews, and everything in between. We include a reasonable use policy to keep things running well for everyone, but it's designed around how real people actually use the app, not to limit you.

---

**Q5: I bought Founders Lifetime. What if I want Pro features later?**

You can subscribe to Pro at any time. Your Founders Lifetime purchase stays yours — it doesn't expire or go away. If you later decide you want cloud sync, advanced AI models, or other Pro-only features, you just add a Pro subscription. The two aren't mutually exclusive.

---

**Q6: What's your refund and cancellation policy?**

Pro subscriptions can be cancelled at any time. You keep access through the end of your billing period. For the Founders Lifetime plan, if something isn't right, reach out to us — we'll work with you. Specific refund terms are outlined in our Terms of Service.

---

**Q7: How does the 30-day free trial work?**

When you choose Pro, you get full access to all Pro features for 30 days at no cost. You won't be charged until the trial ends. If you cancel before the 30 days are up, you pay nothing. No hoops, no hidden steps.

---

**Q8: Why is the Founders plan called "Limited"?**

The Founders Lifetime plan is available to early supporters at a one-time price of $129. This pricing won't last indefinitely. Once the Founders window closes, the one-time option may no longer be available. If you want lifetime core access at a fixed cost, now is the time.

---

## SECTION 5: Footer CTA

**Layout:** Full-width section. Centered text block with headline, subhead, and one or two buttons.

### Copy

**Headline:**
Never Miss What Matters

**Subhead:**
Start with Complete Privacy by default. Try Pro free for 30 days if you want more.

**Buttons (side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile):**
- Primary: `Get Started`
- Secondary: `Try Pro Free for 30 Days`
