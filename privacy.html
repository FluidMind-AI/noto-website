                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

                <p>This website and any other websites of Fluid Mind Inc. (collectively, the "Website"), the NotoNote mobile application (the "App"), and the information on it, and the services and resources available or enabled via the Website and App (each a "Service" and collectively, the "Services") (each Website, App, and Service is a "NotoNote Asset") are controlled by Fluid Mind Inc.

                <h3>Summary</h3>

                <p>At NotoNote, we are committed to protecting the confidentiality, accuracy, and integrity of your Personal Information. Personal Information includes any data that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be linked to a specific individual or household. This does not include aggregated, de-identified, or publicly available information. We prioritize the security of your personal information and understand the importance of keeping it secure.</p>

                <p>We collect information to provide the products and services you request, enhance your experience with us, and support our business operations and objectives, including the fulfillment of our contractual obligations with you. We diligently collect, track, and interpret all data, including your personal information, which helps to reveal what users generally, and you specifically, like and don't like about the NotoNote Assets and our content and advertising.</p>

                <p>We may share data with strategic, trusted partners so that we can better understand and improve your experience and cater to your preferences.</p>

                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

                <p>We collect information you give us when you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Register to use our App or create an account;</li>
                    <li>Place an order (service not yet available);</li>
                    <li>Search for a product, scan a label or wine list;</li>
                    <li>Subscribe to any update service or email communications;</li>
                    <li>Participate in social media functions on the NotoNote Assets;</li>
                    <li>Log into the App using your social media or other profile;</li>
                    <li>Submit a review or rating or enter other information on our App;</li>
                    <li>Interact with our AI chatbot on our App;</li>
                    <li>Specifically register your interest to receive marketing or promotional news or specific product information from us;</li>
                    <li>Contact us by phone, email, social media or chat;</li>
                    <li>Participate in a lottery, auction, prize draw, competition, or promotion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>When you register to use our App or create an account</h4>
                <p>When registering via our App, you provide us with certain information, including email, password, username, name, and preferred language. When registering and signing in via third-party application login (such as Apple or Google), and you authorize us to access certain account information from that third-party application, such as basic profile information; name, profile picture, e-mail address (optional), current city (optional).</p>

                <h4>When using our App</h4>
                <p>We collect the information you provide when using the App, including your note ratings, preferences, interactions with followers or connected friends, your activity on the Platform, and your communications with us, particularly those with our AI chatbot. The AI chatbot may collect information you share during conversations, such as your preferences, questions, and any other details you voluntarily disclose. Users are strongly advised not to share personal data beyond what is necessary for using the App, especially sensitive categories of information (such as health-related details), when interacting with the AI chatbot, submitting reviews, or uploading images.</p>

                <p>If a user voluntarily shares such sensitive information, they are responsible for ensuring that they have a legal basis to disclose this information, and they acknowledge that such information may be processed in line with the stated purpose of the Platform. Our App will ask for your permission to enable the collection of the location of your device. If you have given permission to collect your device location, we will use the location to show you certain offers available around your location as personalized marketing message. Location may also be used for analytics and to detect you are in store or restaurant.</p>

                <p>We use cookies to enable the NotoNote Assets to work, and to provide you with a personalized experience. For further information on our use of Cookies, please see our Cookies Policy.</p>

                <h4>When purchasing products</h4>
                <p><em>(Not yet active)</em> When you purchase products using the NotoNote Assets, you are buying from a third-party vendor, not NotoNote. Consequently, NotoNote facilitates the transaction by passing the order details you submit to the selected third-party vendor. This includes sharing the necessary purchase information, such as your name, contact details, and delivery address, to enable the vendor to fulfill and deliver your order.</p>

                <p>Please note that the third-party vendor becomes an independent controller of the personal data it receives from us for the purpose of processing and delivering your order. While we process and store your purchase information to provide you with our services, such as managing your order history and enhancing your user experience, the vendor independently manages any data it processes after the order is passed to them.</p>

                <h4>Cookies & Clickstream Technology</h4>
                <p>Information we collect using cookies and other tracking technologies relates to your use of the NotoNote Assets and your experience while interacting with them. This includes details such as the full URL clickstream to, through, and from our Website and App, download errors, methods used to browse away from each page, any phone number used to call our customer service number, device information, IP address, usage, and location data. We collect this information to better understand how users engage with the NotoNote Assets and to improve their overall functionality and user experience.</p>

                <p>The tools we use to monitor the functioning of the NotoNote Assets collect certain data that users enter when interacting with the website or App, including personal data such as IP addresses, even if those users do not complete a purchase, post a comment, submit a review, or interact in any other way with the NotoNote Assets. However, we do not record sensitive data such as passwords or plain/raw credit card details during this process.</p>

                <h3>Purpose and Legal Basis</h3>

                <p>We process your personal data to manage your account, provide access to the NotoNote Assets, and fulfill our contractual obligations. Specifically, we process your data to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deliver Services:</strong> Fulfill contractual obligations for your use of our App and related services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhance Experiences:</strong> Use note ratings and preferences, with your consent, to personalize your experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Facilitate Purchases:</strong> Process and facilitate your purchases through third-party vendors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve AI Recommendations:</strong> Analyze your inputs, preferences, and interactions with the AI to enhance its ability to provide tailored note suggestions and insights.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We also process personal data to improve our App, develop new features, personalize services, and implement algorithms or machine learning, based on our legitimate interest to enhance our services.</p>

                <p>Additionally, we may use your data for marketing purposes, including notifying you of new features, updates, or promotions, based on your freely given consent. You can withdraw consent anytime by clicking "Unsubscribe" in marketing emails or by asking our App not to track your activities in your mobile device settings. Without consent, any displayed marketing will be generic and less personalized.</p>

                <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

                <p>We use the information you provide and that we collect via the NotoNote Assets to:</p>

                    <li><strong>Targeted Advertising:</strong> Send locally hashed data to trusted third parties (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat) for personalized advertising.

These communications are sent under the lawful basis of legitimate interest, but you can always opt out.</li>

                    <li>Analyze your interactions with our AI systems to enhance their performance, accuracy, and user experience;</li>
                    <li>Ensure compliance with our Terms and prevent misuse of our AI features.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In accordance with the law, we will only retain your personal information for the period necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it was provided. We keep this data under periodic review to ensure it is still necessary for us to retain it. If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also retain some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.</p>

                <h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>

                <p>We may share your personal information with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Affiliated Companies and Trusted Partners:</strong> These include strategic partners who help us operate NotoNote and enhance your experience. Examples include warehousing and delivery providers, payment processors, marketing and advertising services, IT hosting, and market research firms.

                    <li><strong>Fraud Prevention Partners:</strong> To ensure transaction security and prevent fraudulent activity, we may share your information with fraud screening partners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Compliance and Transactions:</strong> We may disclose your personal information to comply with legal obligations, enforce our rights, or protect the security and integrity of the NotoNote Assets.

                </ul>

                <h4>Social Media Plugins and Third-Party Content</h4>
                <p>The NotoNote Assets may include social media plugins or links to third-party content (e.g., videos hosted externally). Certain data, such as your IP address, email address, pages you visit after leaving the NotoNote Assets, and the date and time of access, may be forwarded to these social media platforms or third-party sites, even if you are not registered with them. If you are logged into a social media service, it may also associate this data with your username or real name.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, we do not control the extent, nature, or purpose of how these platforms or sites process your data. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand their practices.</p>

                <h4>Sharing Information Related to AI Features</h4>
                <p>We may share anonymized data collected from your interactions with our AI features with our AI service providers to improve and develop our AI systems. These providers are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and are only permitted to use your information as necessary to perform services on our behalf.</p>

                <p>You can rest assured that we'll only disclose your information for the specific purposes mentioned above and that your data security is being taken care of. The relevant third parties are bound to process your personal data only on our strict instructions and, even then, only when they can offer adequate technical and organizational measures to protect it. We will not share your personal information beyond these purposes unless you provide explicit consent or sharing is required by law.</p>

                <h3>Transferring Data to Third Countries</h3>

                <p>NotoNote may engage suppliers located outside of your country of residence to process data on our behalf. When we do so, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by relevant regulatory authorities, to protect your personal data and ensure compliance with applicable laws.</p>

                <h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>

                <p>We adopt technical and organizational measures to protect your data effectively across the NotoNote Assets, including our website and app. Our employees and contractors are bound by confidentiality, and we carefully select and monitor our service providers to ensure they comply with high-security standards for safeguarding your personal data.</p>

                <p>To protect your data against unauthorized access, we use data encryption protocols. Data collected from the NotoNote Assets is transmitted securely between your device and our servers using PCI-compliant encryption (minimum TLS, Transport Layer Security, version 1.2). For sensitive payment data, such as bank and credit card details, we rely on trusted payment processors who employ in-transit encryption (e.g., SSL, Secure Socket Layer) to ensure your information remains secure from the moment it is entered.</p>

                <p>Payment data is encrypted and securely processed and stored by our payment processor in accordance with their Privacy Policy. For added security, payment card details are stored and accessed only in encrypted formats within the payment processor's database and never as plain raw data.</p>

                <h3>Your Rights (And How to Exercise Them!)</h3>

                <p>If you wish to exercise any of your statutory rights regarding the personal data we hold about you, please contact us at hello@fluidmind.ai. Once we receive all necessary information, we will handle your request promptly and notify you upon completion.</p>

                <p>In certain circumstances, you may have the right to:</p>

                    <li>Request the deletion or removal of your personal data (please note we may be legally required to retain some data, such as order details for tax purposes);</li>
                    <li>Object to specific processing of your personal data;</li>
                    <li>Request that we update or correct inaccurate personal data we hold about you;</li>

                </ul>

                <p>You may also withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your profile or account through the in-app settings.</p>

                <p>When you submit a request to access, correct, delete, or port your data, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity and protect the security of your personal data.</p>

                <p>We will address your request promptly and fairly. If you remain dissatisfied with our response, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority in your jurisdiction.</p>

                <h3>Data Retention and Account Deletion</h3>

                <p>We store your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our services. We may also retain and use your personal data to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our agreements.</p>

                <p>If you choose to delete your account, you can follow the instructions on the NotoNote Assets or contact us at hello@fluidmind.ai. If you delete your account, we will remove your personal data from our systems, except where retention is required for compliance with legal obligations, dispute resolution, fraud prevention, or enforcement of our agreements.</p>

                <p>Any content you have provided (such as media, reviews or comments) may be anonymized or deleted, subject to our data retention policies and legal obligations. Additionally, we may retain non-personal or fully anonymized data for legitimate purposes, such as analytics, improving services, and compliance with applicable regulations.
