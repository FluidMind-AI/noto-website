                <h3>12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the British Virgin Islands (BVI).</p>

                <p>In the event of a dispute arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the interpretation, performance, or breach of our or your obligations or duties relating to your use of the Services ("Dispute"), there may be a risk of public disclosure of confidential information if such a Dispute is litigated in court. In order to avoid such public disclosure, you agree that, at our option, any Dispute (other than a regulatory complaint) may be settled by confidential binding arbitration administered by the BVI International Arbitration Centre ("BVI IAC") in accordance with the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules currently in force. The law of this arbitration clause shall be BVI law. The place of arbitration shall be Road Town, Tortola, BVI, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. In the event we cannot agree on the identity of an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected by the Chief Executive Officer of the BVI IAC drawing only from the accredited international panel of arbitrators registered with the BVI IAC. For the purposes of this clause, a regulatory complaint is any complaint to the BVI General Legal Council.</p>

                <h4>13.4 Waiver</h4>
