                    <li><strong>"Browser"</strong> means a computer program that makes it possible for users to read information on the internet.</li>

                    <li><strong>"Web server"</strong> means a computer system that runs websites and delivers web pages and information to internet users.</li>

                <h3>Explaining Cookies</h3>

                <p>Cookies are small text files consisting of letters and numbers, which will be stored on the device of the user when accessing the internet. Cookies are installed through the request sent by a web server to a browser and are completely passive, which means that they do not contain software, viruses or spyware and cannot access the information on the hard drive of the user. Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them or by any other website that uses the same cookies. This way websites can find out if a device has visited them before.</p>

                <p>A cookie contains information that links the user browser to the website. Each time the user returns to the website, the web server will read the information already stored and the website will not ask the user again regarding the user options, for example, in terms of online privacy, the language of the website, the saving of registration data or relevant advertising.</p>

                <p>In most cases, the use of cookies does not personally identify users.</p>

                <h4>Advantages of using cookies</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> cookies can be available for a longer period. Once the cookies are stored on the user's device, they will be available if the user won't delete them manually or until they reach their lifetime span. Even if the web server fails, information can be retrieved from the cookies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Besides websites, cookies can also remember information related to forms. So, each time the user visits the website, the addressed form will be filled in automatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Server Load:</strong> All the data related to cookies are stored on the device without the use of web server resources. No extra load or weight is added to the web server.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Type of Cookies Based on Ownership</h3>

                <p>Cookies can generally be installed by the owner of the accessed website (so-called own cookies) or by other websites (so-called third-party cookies). This Cookie Policy does not cover the use of cookies by such third parties and for more information regarding those cookies, please check the cookie and privacy policies of the third parties.</p>

                <p><strong>Own cookies</strong> are used to estimate the number of unique visitors, to improve the website or to detect the most searched words in search engines that lead to a web page. Also, these cookies are used to learn how the website works, to perform relevant improvements, and to improve user's browsing experience. These cookies are not used to target the user through online marketing.</p>

                <p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong> are not placed directly by the visited website. Cookies belong to service providers or social media that check how users interact with the content of a specific website. These cookies retain what users have done on the website pages and how they interacted with the website.</p>

                <p>For instructions on how to block or delete cookies, see the dedicated section below.</p>

                <h3>Types of Cookies Based on Their Purpose</h3>

                <p>Some cookies are necessary to allow the user to browse the website, use its functionalities and access secure areas. The use of such cookies is essential for the website to work.</p>

                <p>Cookies commonly used on websites are classified as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strictly necessary or Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are essential for browsing the website and using its functions, such as page navigation and accessing secure areas. The website cannot work properly without such cookies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information about how the user uses a website &ndash; for example, the pages visited, and the errors displayed. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and do not store information that identifies the user. All information that such cookies collect is anonymous and is used only to improve how the website works. If the users do not allow these cookies, the website owner will not know when they have visited the website and will not be able to monitor the website performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preference or Functional cookies:</strong> These cookies allow a website to remember information that changes how the website interacts, such as the username of the user, preferred language, or region. These cookies may also be used to remember changes made by a user, such as text size, font, and other parts of web pages they may customize. They may be set up by the website owner or by third party providers whose services were added to the website pages. The information these cookies collect may be anonymous and cannot track the browsing activity of the user on other websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tailored content cookies:</strong> These cookies help a website provide enhanced features and display content in a way that is relevant to a user. These cookies help a website determine what information to display to a user based on how they previously used the website. These cookies do not track the browsing activity of the user on other websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics or statistical cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to collect and report aggregated anonymous information about the number of visitors and how they used the website. These cookies collect information for statistical purposes only and use only pseudonymous cookie identifiers that directly identify the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting or marketing cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to track users on websites to provide more relevant and attractive advertising to the user. They are also used to limit how many times a user sees an ad, as well as to help measure the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. These cookies remember that a user has visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as third-party marketing and advertising agencies. This means that after a user has been on a website, he or she can see some advertisements about that website elsewhere on the internet. These cookies may be set through the website by owner's advertising partners. Although such cookies may track the user device visits on websites, they usually cannot personally identify the user, but are based on uniquely identifying user's browser and device. If the users do not allow these cookies, they will experience less targeted advertising.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social media and content cookies:</strong> These cookies are placed by several social media plugins (e.g., the "like" button on Facebook) and other tools designed to provide or improve content on a website (e.g., services that allow the playing of video files or create comment sections). These cookies are integrated to improve the browsing and interaction experience with the website. They can track the user's browser across other websites and build up a profile of user interests. This may impact the content and messages the users see on other websites they visit. Some of these third-party services place cookies that are also used for behavioral advertising, analytics and/or market research. If the users do not allow these cookies, they may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Type of Cookies Based on Lifetime</h3>

                <p>The lifetime of a cookie can vary significantly, depending on its purpose. Some cookies are used exclusively for a single session (so-called session cookies) and shall be deleted from the user device immediately after the browsing session ends. Such cookies are temporarily stored in the cookie folder of the browser until the user leaves the respective website or closes the browser window (for example when logging in/logging out to a web-mail account or to social networks).</p>

                <p>Other cookies remain stored on the user's device and will be reused each time he or she returns to the website (so-called persistent cookies), allowing the website to recognize the device in the event of a subsequent visit to the website. Persistent cookies also include those cookies placed by a website other than the one the user is currently visiting &ndash; known as "third party cookies" (see the dedicated section above) &ndash; which can be used anonymously to memorize the interests of a user so that the most relevant advertising for users is delivered.</p>

                <h3>Cookies Used on Our Website</h3>
